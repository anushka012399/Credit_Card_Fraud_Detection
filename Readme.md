# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Implemented Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor and Logistic Regression algorithms to choose the best model to classify a transaction as fraudulent or legitimate.<br><br>
***Dataset Description***<br>
In this research experiment, we would be using real life data obtained from Kaggle. The dataset obtained, contained 284,807 transactions made by European credit cardholders over
a period of two days in September 2013. The dataset obtained, contained 492 fraud transactions which accounts for only 0.172% of all transactions. This implies that the data set is highly imbalanced.<br>
This dataset has 31 attributes:<br>
Independent variables:<br>
i) Time – This tells the elapsed number of seconds between current transaction and the first
transaction in the dataset.<br>
ii) V1-V28 – These attributes are a result of PCA Dimensionality reduction. This was done to
prevent the client sensitive information.<br>
iii) Amount – amount being transmitted<br><br>
Dependent variable:<br>
iv) Class – the class label is 1 if the transaction is fraudulent and 0 if its legitimate.<br><br>
